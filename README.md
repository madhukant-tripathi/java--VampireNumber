# Vampire Number Program

This Java program checks whether a number is a Vampire Number or not.
The logic is written by me.

## What is a Vampire Number
A Vampire Number is a number that is made by multiplying two numbers.
The digits of the result are the same as the original number.

## Example
Input:
1260

Output:

(21 × 60)
